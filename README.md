# JavaPractise

This repository is a collection of Java files which I am using to learn fundamentals of Java Programming Language.

## I have commented a lot on the codes, which should help you understand what is going on.

### To run on local
1. Clone on your local machine
2. To compile, use terminal or cmd. 
3. Make sure, you have java installed. Type `java --version` 
4. Type `javac FILE_NAME.java` for `FILE_NAME` that you want to compile, which will generate a .class file on successful compilation.
5. Finally type `java FILE_NAME` to run the code and see result.
